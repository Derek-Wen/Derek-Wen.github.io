San Diego Gas & Electric utilizes a variety of public and private data sources for making critical decisions that impact our communities. This project investigates the use of Google Street View, a publicly accessible data source, to identify risks visible from the perspective of San Diego citizens. A Python script is employed to collect images of power lines and overhead structures, which then serve to train a computer vision model (DETR). The model undergoes fine-tuning, and the project proceeds to analyze its results and accuracy.
