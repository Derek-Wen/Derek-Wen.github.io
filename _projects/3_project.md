This project focused on analyzing Amazon product reviews from the "Movies and TV" category using various machine learning models. It explored the relationship between review characteristics like text length, exclamation marks, and review time with product ratings. The team experimented with models including FPMC, latent factor models, and linear regression, with features like user and product IDs, review text, and timestamps. The project aimed to understand temporal dynamics in ratings, and the most successful model incorporated time features, achieving a test MSE of 0.9326.
