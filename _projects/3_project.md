This project focuses on analyzing Amazon product reviews from the "Movies and TV" category using various machine learning models. It explores the relationship between review characteristics such as text length, exclamation marks, and review time with product ratings. We experimented with models including FPMC, latent factor models, and linear regression, with features like user and product IDs, review text, and timestamps. This project aims to understand temporal dynamics in ratings, and the most successful model incorporated time features achieved a test MSE of 0.9326.
