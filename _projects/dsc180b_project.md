This project leverages computer vision and Google Street View images to enhance the monitoring of utility poles, an important factor in preventing wildfires and ensuring community safety. The traditional methods of keeping records on these poles have been manual and prone to errors, leading to incomplete data. This project automates the process, using computer vision to identify and categorize utility poles efficiently, comparing the results with existing databases to validate its effectiveness. Essentially, it streamlines the monitoring process, significantly reducing the need for laborious manual checks and improving the accuracy and completeness of the utility pole records, which is a big step forward in harnessing technology for infrastructure management and safety enhancement.
